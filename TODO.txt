- Prepare 64 bits support, specially for file format.
- bv310FieldAccessor/bv310BaseAccessor : bugs using joined fields, need to test and fix it.
- bMITABTable : avoid loading all mitab_feature when opening table. May be better to load only feature_ids.
- bPGisTable : too slow, need to find a better way.


Done :
- WMSCapabilitiesParser : still uses CFXMLTree deprecated APIs, rewrite it with libxml2 library.
